# Traffic-light
It's a code for NodeMCU 1.0(ESP12-E Module ) to control three traffic lights with Blynk application to open the road to Ambulance. 
In blynk application there is a 3-buttons when you press at the first button, for example, the other green traffic light must change to yellow for 5 seconds then to red and the first one become green for 10 seconds so the Ambulance go. 
You can change the number of seconds freely as you want without understanding the whole project since I put them as variables.
