# Traffic-light
It's a code for Nodemcu to control three traffic lights with Blynk application to open the road to Ambulance.
In blynk application there is a 3-buttons, when you press at the first button for example,
the other green traffic light must change to yellow for 5 seconds then to red and the first one become green so the Ambulance go.
You can change the number of seconds freely as you want without understand the whole project, since i put them as variables.
